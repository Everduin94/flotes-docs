## Enhanced Feedback

> *Does not require setup*

Flotes pro will track feedback and object measurments during study sessions **on a per-note basis**. This unlocks many potential features to improve your notes
- Identify problem areas
- Find strengths and weaknesses
- Split or simplify where too difficult
- Aggregate or add challenge where too easy

In this example, Data Structures and Algorithm Computer Science notes have been highlighted with their current status from the last study session.

A more advanced example calculates the status from multiple study session or objective measures. Advanced statuses like this can help identify problem areas or room for improvement
- **Very easy** identifies areas to increase the challenge or combine multiple very easy into a single more challenging note
- **Leech** can identify notes that are taking significant amounts of time to study and may be difficult to understand
- **Stagnating** highlights notes that seem medium difficulty, but are deceptively difficult, because they aren't getting easier with practice.
