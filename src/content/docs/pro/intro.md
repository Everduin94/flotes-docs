## Cloud Sync Canvas

The canvas feature of Flotes saves to your **browser locally**. With a pro subscription, **canvas will save to a server**. This means your data is **available across all devices**. This also **protects your canvas data** in the event of your computer crashing or browser cache being cleared.


:::note[Publish Canvas]
Pro users can share their canvas with others. Setting a Notebook to public will publish the canvas. This can be a great way to create interesting & engaging content for others.

See example: [Signals Deep Dive Canvas](http://localhost:5173/public/ðŸ“¡-angular-signals-guide-6j1RJNknv?c=true)

## Enhanced Feedback

> *Does not require setup*

Flotes pro will track feedback and object measurments during study sessions **on a per-note basis**. This unlocks many potential features to improve your notes
- Identify problem areas
- Find strengths and weaknesses
- Split or simplify where too difficult
- Aggregate or add challenge where too easy

In this example, Data Structures and Algorithm Computer Science notes have been highlighted with their current status from the last study session.

A more advanced example calculates the status from multiple study session or objective measures. Advanced statuses like this can help identify problem areas or room for improvement
- **Very easy** identifies areas to increase the challenge or combine multiple very easy into a single more challenging note
- **Leech** can identify notes that are taking significant amounts of time to study and may be difficult to understand
- **Stagnating** highlights notes that seem medium difficulty, but are deceptively difficult, because they aren't getting easier with practice.
