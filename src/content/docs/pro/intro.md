## Generate Notebooks with AI

Create notebooks on any topic almost instantly using powerful AI models. Flotes uses the sophisticated [Claude-Sonnet 3.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) model to generate notebooks pre-configured with fill in the blanks, links to resources, and detailed explanations.

## Cloud Sync Canvas

> _Does not require setup_

The canvas feature of Flotes saves to your **browser locally**. With a pro subscription, **canvas will save to a server**. This means your data is **available across all devices**. This also **protects your canvas data** in the event of your computer crashing or browser cache being cleared.

:::note[Publish Canvas]
Pro users can share their canvas with others. Setting a Notebook to public will publish the canvas. This can be a great way to create interesting & engaging content for others.

## Enhanced Feedback

> _Does not require setup_

Flotes pro will track self-evaluation and objective measurements during study sessions **on a per-note basis**. This unlocks many potential features to improve your notes

- Identify problem areas
- Find strengths and weaknesses
- Split or simplify where too difficult
- Aggregate or add challenge where too easy

In this example, Data Structures and Algorithm Computer Science notes have been highlighted with their current status from the last study session.

A more advanced example calculates the status from multiple study session or objective measures. Advanced statuses like this can help identify problem areas or room for improvement

- **Very easy** identifies areas to increase the challenge or combine multiple very easy into a single more challenging note
- **Leech** can identify notes that are taking significant amounts of time to study and may be difficult to understand
- **Stagnating** highlights notes that seem medium difficulty, but are deceptively difficult, because they aren't getting easier with practice.
