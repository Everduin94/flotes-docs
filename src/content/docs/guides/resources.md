title: Resources
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

A resource notebook might be anything you need to keep note of, but **don't** need to study.
- Reference material like links, sources, or authors
- A scratch pad for future ideas, todo items, or drafts
- A notebook you might study in the future but have put on pause.

How is a resource different than archives?
- Resources *can be archived*
- Resources distinguish that notebook is not designed for study sessions.
- Resources don't track spaced repetition but still show up in your focused notebook list

For examples of archives, see the [archives documentation](https://docs.flotes.app/guides/archives).


:::note[PARA]
The term *resource* is borrowed from Tiago Forte's PARA (Projects Areas Resources Archives).
