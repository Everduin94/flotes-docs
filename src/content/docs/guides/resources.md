## What is a Resource? 

Resources are an organizational component of Flotes. A Resource-Notebook might be anything you need to keep note of, but **don't** need to study.
- Reference material like links, sources, or authors
- A scratch pad for future ideas, todo items, or drafts
- A notebook you might study in the future but have put on pause.

:::note[PARA]
The term *resource* is borrowed from Tiago Forte's PARA (Projects Areas Resources Archives).

### Why Mark as Resource?

Marking a Notebook as a Resource distinguishes that the Notebook is not meant to be studied or use spaced repetition. Resource-Notebooks show up at the *bottom* of your active Notebook list, unless archived. 

:::note[Archiving]
Resource-Notebooks can be Archived. The two states are not mutually exclusive.
