title: Resources
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

A resource notebook might be anything you need to keep note of, but **don't** need to study.
- Reference material like links, sources, or authors
- A scratch pad for future ideas, todo items, or drafts
- A notebook you might study in the future but have put on pause.

:::note[PARA]
The term *resource* is borrowed from Tiago Forte's PARA (Projects Areas Resources Archives).
