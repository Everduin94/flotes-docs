## What are Archives?

Archiving is an organizational component of Flotes. There are two forms of archiving in Flotes. 
- **Archive a notebook**
- **Archive a note**

The term *archive* is borrowed from Tiago Forte's PARA (Projects Areas Resources Archives).

### Why Archive a Notebook?

Archiving a notebook in Flotes hides the notebook behind the archive toggle. This accomplishes a few things:
- **Most importantly**, it keeps your active notebook list clean, organized and focused on what matters
- Allows you to "pause" a notebook's spaced repetition
- Creates a clear distinction between what should be focused on

### Why Archive a Note?

Archiving a note simply removes the note from study sessions.
- Useful when a note becomes too easy. This makes study sessions have desirable difficulty and be efficient.
- Allows you to create notes purely for reference in a notebook meant for studying
