Flotes can link notes to each other using wikipedia style backlinks. In the note editor, type `[[` to search and select other notes within the notebook. This will create a previewable backlink to that note.

## Creating a Second Brain / Digital Garden

This feature allows you to build a “second brain” — a personal knowledge system where notes are naturally connected. This creates a web of relationships that makes your ideas easier to explore, navigate, and remember.

:::note[Custom Links]
Backlinks in Flotes are technically plain markdown links. Search is currently limited to notes within the notebook. However, you can link to anywhere in Flotes and it will format as a backlink.
