Each notebook in Flotes can be further organized into categories:

- **Active** *(default)*: The standard state for notebooks you're currently editing and studying. This is applied implicitly unless another state is selected. Active notebooks are sorted and prioritized by their [review status](/concepts/review).
- <span style="color: #89b4fa">**Resources**</span>: Notebooks with referential information that do *not* need to be studied.
- <span style="color: #89dceb">**Archives**</span>: Notebooks that are no longer in active use.

These states help you keep your workspace focused by separating active work from reference materials and completed content.

:::note[PARA]
The terms *resource* and *archive* are borrowed from [Tiago Forte's PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) (Projects Areas Resources Archives).

Active is similar to *areas*, with the focus being on areas you're actively learning.

Since these states are built into Flotes. You can mark notebooks as a resource, archive, or both. Without having to move the notebook to a different folder, losing its original context.
:::


### Why Mark as Resource?

Marking a Notebook as a Resource distinguishes that the Notebook is not meant to be studied or use spaced repetition. Resource-Notebooks show up at the *bottom* of your active Notebook list, unless archived. 
- Reference material like links, sources, or authors
- A scratch pad for future ideas, todo items, or drafts
- Information that is purely referential and doesn't need reviewed

:::note[Archiving]
Resources can be archived. The two categories are not mutually exclusive.
:::


### Why Archive a Notebook?

Archiving a notebook in Flotes hides the notebook behind the archive filter:
- Keeps your active notebook list organized and focused on what currently matters
- Allows you to *pause* a notebook's [spacing review](/concepts/review)

:::note[Archiving Notes]

Individual notes can also be archived, removing that note from future study sessions. This keeps study sessions focused on what matters, without deleting any content.

## User Defined Tags

You can also assign custom tags to a notebook. This can be useful for filtering large amounts of active notebooks or resources by topic or context. 

Tags can provide a lot of organizational benefit, without having to restructure your notebooks.
- Create overlapping categories
- Provide additional context 
- Filter by theme or topic
