A notebook can be viewed in multiple formats geared towards learning.

- [**Study**](/concepts/views/#study-view): Similar to flashcard applications. Fill in blanks and self-evaluate.
- [**Summary**](/concepts/views/#summary-view): Aggregate all notes into long-form content.
- [**Canvas**](/concepts/views/#canvas-view): Plot notes onto a canvas. Add connections, groups, and embed content.

## Study View

Study is the core learning view in Flotes, designed for focused, memory-efficient review. Use the study view to practice active recall. Notes are rendered with [fill-in-the-blanks](/concepts/notes/#fill-in-the-blanks) and [concealed sections](/concepts/notes/#concealed-sections).  
Grade yourself, track your progress, and review your notebook at a later date using [spaced repetition](/concepts/review).

### Grading Options

When studying, you’ll choose one of the following options as self-evaluation or grading of how well you knew the information.

- <span style="color: #a6e3a1">**Easy**</span>: You know it effortlessly
- <span style="color: #94e2d5">**Good**</span>: You understand or know it with some effort
- <span style="color: #f9e2af">**Hard**</span>: You struggled to understand or remember
- <span style="color: #f5c2e7">**Again**</span>: Repeat this notes fill in the blanks / concealed sections
- <span style="color: #89dceb">**Archive**</span>: Remove this note from future study sessions
- **Skip**: Skip grading this note (no impact on your stats)

:::note[Flashcards vs Flotes]

Flotes does not space individual notes like cards in a flashcard applications. Spacing is done entirely at the notebook level.

This emphasizes grading by understanding and long-term retention. Avoiding an illusion of competence, simply because you saw the answer recently.

**Archive** and **Skip** should be used actively for notes that are no longer challenging. This keeps study sessions efficient and fast, without relying on traditional per-card spacing.

## Summary View


<div style="border: 1px solid rgba(108, 112, 134, .5); border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, .35) 0 5px 15px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <img style="border-radius: 12px; object-fit: cover; object-position: top; max-height: 20rem; width: 100%" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/flotes/summary-v2-final.png?updatedAt=1746882560872"  />

The Study View in Flotes encourages you to break down information into small, focused chunks — great for learning, but sometimes limiting when you want to see the full picture.

The Summary View offsets this by combining all notes in a notebook into a single, long-form page. This provides a complete, readable overview of your material — useful for reviewing the full context of a topic.

:::note[Sharing Summaries]

The Summary View can function as a shareable document. It’s ideal for turning your notebook into a blog post, documentation, or a condensed version of your notes to share with others.

## Canvas View


<div style="border: 1px solid rgba(108, 112, 134, .5); border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, .35) 0 5px 15px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <img style="border-radius: 12px; object-fit: cover; object-position: top; max-height: 20rem; width: 100%" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/flotes/canvas-1.png?updatedAt=1746833910934"  />
</div>

Notes stored as files—like in Markdown or most editors—are typically viewed in a linear fashion. While effective for writing and reading, this structure can limit how ideas are organized or connected across multiple notes.

The canvas view offsets this limitation by allowing notes to be placed visually on an infinite canvas. You can group related concepts, draw links between notes, and arrange them spatially to reflect your thinking.

:::note[Open Format Canvas]

Canvas can be exported using the open JSON Canvas specification, making them compatible with other tools that support the format. This approach avoids vendor lock-in and ensures your entire canvas—including note positions, links, and embeds—can be freely exported.
