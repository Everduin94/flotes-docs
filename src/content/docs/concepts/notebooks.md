[Notes](/concepts/notes) are organized into Notebooks— customizable modules of notes with [interactive views](/concepts/views). Notebooks can optionally be grouped into Folders— purely for organizational purposes.

#### Organization

Notebooks are sorted in the side-nav by **study priority**.

- <span style="color: #a6e3a1">**Ready to Study**</span>: Notebooks that are ready to study float to the top.
- <span style="color: #89b4fa">**Resources**</span> & <span style="color: #94e2d5">**Completed**</span>: Resources and completed notebooks fall to the bottom.
- <span style="color: #89dceb">**Archives**</span>: Archived notebooks are hidden unless explicitly shown in the filter options.

:::note[Flat vs Nested]{icon="list-format"}

Folders cannot be nested. This keeps your notebooks in a semi-flat structure.

- To further organize your notebooks- try utilizing [categories](/concepts/categories), [tags](/concepts/categories/#user-defined-tags), and [linking](/concepts/backlinks).

:::

#### Sharing

Notebooks have 3 different visibilty / privacy states.

- <span style="color: #cba6f7">**Private**</span>: Only visible to you. (Default)
- <span style="color: #89b4fa">**Shared**</span>: Can be accessed by any Flotes users with the link.
- <span style="color: #a6e3a1">**Public**</span>: Publicly visible on the web. Can be viewed by anyone with or without the link.

:::note[Shareable Views]{icon="email"}

Public and shared notebooks can link directly to a specific [view](/concepts/views).

- [**Study**](/concepts/views/#study-view): Share a direct link to a study session.
- [**Summary**](/concepts/views/#summary-view): Publish notes as a blog post or long-form content.
- [**Canvas**](/concepts/views/#canvas-view): Share an infinite canvas as an interactive study roadmap.

:::

#### Options

These settings effect the state and behavior of [views](/concepts/views) and [review spacing](/concepts/spacing) per notebook.

- **Randomize**: Notes appear in a random order during study sessions.
- **Variability**: Varies which words are blanked during study sessions.
- **Stagger Spacing**: Spaces study sessions using a staggered interval (1, 2, 5, 8... days).
- **Sessions to Completion**: Sets how many successful study sessions are required to mark the notebook as complete (1–10).

#### Actions

Notebooks have additional actions for [organizing](concepts/notebooks/#organization), [sharing](concepts/notebooks/#sharing), and creating [notes](/concepts/notes).

- **Set as Resource**: Marks the notebook as a resource.
- **Reset Progress**: Resets your study completion back to zero, without deleting historical stats.
- **Archive Notebook**: Hides the notebook from your personal active list.
- **Import Notes**: Upload markdown files to add multiple notes to the notebook at once.
- **Export Notes**: Download the notebook’s notes as plain markdown files.
- **Generate Notes**: Utilize models to generate content by title and description.
- **Reorder Notes**: Reorder notes to control the presentation order.
- **Share Notebook**: Generate a link to share view / write access.
- **Publish Notebook**: Generate a shareable link and make this notebook publicly visible.
