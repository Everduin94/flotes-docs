## General

**Fill in the Blank Token** - Default `2`
> Number of underscores to determine a fill in the blank

Options
- `2`
- `3`
- `off`

Changes the number of underscores required to create a fill in the blank. The 3 token syntax is still portable as 3 underscores translates to bold+italic in basic Markdown.

:::tip

This preference is ideal for users with code blocks that have double underscores. Setting this preference to **3** will prevent code snippets from creating fill in the blanks when not desired.
