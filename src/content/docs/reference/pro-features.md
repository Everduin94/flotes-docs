## Generate Notebooks with AI

> Does not require setup

Create notebooks on any topic almost instantly using powerful AI models. Flotes uses [Claude-Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) model to generate notebooks pre-configured with fill in the blanks, links to resources, and detailed explanations.

## Cloud Sync & Publish Canvas

> _Does not require setup_

The canvas feature of Flotes saves to your **browser locally**. With a pro subscription, **canvas will save to a server**. This means your data is **available across all devices**. This also **protects your canvas data** in the event of your computer crashing or browser cache being cleared.

:::note[Publish Canvas]
Pro users can share their canvas with others. Setting a Notebook to public will publish the canvas. This can be a great way to create interesting & engaging content for others.

- Split or simplify where too difficult
- Aggregate or add challenge where too easy


## Webhooks

> _Requires some setup_

Integrate Flotes with 100s of other apps like: **Trello, Notion, Google Calendar, G-Mail, Todoist**

- Create todos out of future study sessions
- Automatically schedule the optimal study date in other apps
- Upload notes to other note-taking or storage apps after archiving a notebook
